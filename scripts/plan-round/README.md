1. **Tournament player** - A club member that signed up for a tournament;
2. **Tournament Rank** - Also, rank, a player current tournament score and their tournament ELO rate; we use the later to break ties;
3. **Tournament player acceptable piece colors** - An array of strings with two entries, describing the player' acceptable piece colors for their next game:
   1. If no entries, either color; we have a bias to assigning the white game pieces to lower ranked players;
   1. The string at index 0, if present, it represents the player first preferred game pieces color for their next game, which is the opposite to the player's last game pieces color;
   1. The string at index 1, if present, it represents the player second game pieces color preference for their next game, only and if only the player has not played with it in their last two games;
4. **Tournament players** - The array of tournament players
5. **Work Tournament players** - A copy of the  array of tournament players, sorted by rank;
6. **Candidate Round** - A tournament round under construction; it becomes a Tournament Game when the Tournament Director officially starts it;
7. **Candidate Game** - A game under construction; it becomes a Tournament Game when the Tournament Director officially starts its round;
8. **Candidate Game Player** - A Tournament Player, selected from the Work Tournament players array under consideration for a Candidate Game;
9. **Opponent Candidate Game Player** - A Tournament Player, selected from the Work Tournament players array under consideration to play against a Candidate Game Playe;

# Algorithm
1. Build the `Work Tournament Players` array:
   1. Select the `round bye player`, if necessary
      1. If the `Work Tournament Players` array length is odd:
         1. Select the lowest ranked player who has not had a previous bye or forfeit round as this roundâ€™s bye player;
         2. Create a `Game Bye`;
            1. Add the selected player;
            2. Add the `Game Bye` to the `Candidate Round`;
         3. Add the `Game Bye` to the `Round Candidate`;
         4. Remove the `selected player` from the `Work Tournament Players` array;
2. Repeat
   1. Create a `Game Candidate`;
   2. Select a `Game Candidate Player`:
      1. The first `Work Tournament Array` element is the Game `Candidate Player`;
      2. Use their first preferred game pieces color for their next game, if present, or Black Pieces, if none, as their game pieces color;
      3. Add it to `Game Candidate`
   3. Build the `Opponent Candidate Players` array
      1. Only append `Opponent Candidates Players` who have not played against the `Game Candidate Player` in the tournament;
      2. Determine the `Work Tournament Players` array `mid ranked player`;
      3. Starting at the `mid ranked player`, append it and all `higher ranked` players until the `Game Candidate Player`;
      4. Starting at the` mid ranked player`, append all `lower ranked players`;
   4. Find a suitable `Opponent Candidate Player
      1. For each `Opponent Candidate Player` in `Opponent Candidates Players`:
         1. Add it to the `Candidate Game`;
         2. Use their `first preferred game pieces color for their next game`, or While Pieces if none, as their game's pieces color;
         3. Calculate the `Candidate Game players` game pieces colors`:
            1. If both `Candidate Game players` same game piece color:
               1. Assign the first preferred game pieces color for their next game, if present, to the lower ranked player;
               2. If both candidates same game piece color:
                  1. Assign the first preferred game pieces color for their next game, if present, to the highest ranked player;
                  2. If both candidates same game piece color:
                     1. Set the `Opponent Candidate Player` to `Result<<ITournamentPlayer, NULL>>` = null;
         4. If Result<<ITournamentPlayer, NULL>>.err
            1. Select the first  `Opponent Candidate Player` in `Opponent Candidates`
         5. Create a `Tournament Game`
            1. If Result<<ITournamentPlayer, NULL>>.err
               1. Select the first  `Opponent Candidate Player` in `Opponent Candidates`;
               2. Add a  `Tournament Game` flag for the `Tournament Director` to review the game;
            2. Assign `first preferred game pieces color for their next game` to the `lowest ranked player`;
            3. Assign the opposite game pieces color for their next game to the `highest ranked player`;
         6. Add the `Tournament Game` to the `Tournament Round`
            1. Remove the `Game Candidate Player` and the `Opponent Game Candidate Player` from the `Work Tournament Players` array
         7. Repeat 2.2
