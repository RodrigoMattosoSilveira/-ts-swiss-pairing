# Algorithm
1. Build the Work Tournament Array:
   1. If the Work Tournament Players Array length is odd:
      1. Select the lowest ranked player who has not had a previous bye or forfeit round as this roundâ€™s bye player;
      2. Create a Candidate Game Bye;
         1. Add the selected player;
         2. Add the Candidate Game Bye to the Candidate Tournament;
      3. Add Tournament Game to the Tournament Round;
      4. Remove the selected player from the Work Tournament Players Array;
2. Repeat
   1. Select a Game Candidate:
      1. Select the Game Candidate Player;
         1. Pick first Work Tournament Array element;
         2. Add them to  Game Candidate ;
         3. Use their first preferred game pieces color for their next game, if present, or Black Pieces, if none, as their game pieces color;
   2. Build the Opponent Candidates array
      1. Determine the Work Tournament Array mid ranked player;
         1. Copy the mid ranked player and its lower add all players who have not played against the Game Candidate Player in the tournament;
   3. For each Opponent Candidate in Opponent Candidates
      1. Add it to the  Candidate Game; use their first preferred game pieces color for their next game, or While Pieces if none, as their game's pieces color;
      2. If both candidates same game piece color:
         1. Assign the first preferred game pieces color for their next game, if present, to the lowest ranking player;
         2. If both candidates same game piece color:
            1. Assign the first preferred game pieces color for their next game, if present, to the highest ranking player;
            2. If both candidates same game piece color:
               1. Create a Tournament Game
                  1. Assign first preferred game pieces color for their next game to the lowest ranked player
                  2. Assign the opposite game pieces color for their next game to the highest ranked player
                  3. Add a flag for the Tournament Director to review this game
               2. Add Tournament Game to the Tournament Round
               3. Remove the Game Candidate Player and the Opponent Game Candidate Player from the Work Tournament Array
               4. Repeat 2.3
      3. If Opponent candidate Game Candidate Player not found
         1. Select the first  Opponent Candidate in Opponent Candidates
      4. Create a Tournament Game
         1. Assign first preferred game pieces color for their next game to the lowest ranked player
         2. Assign the opposite game pieces color for their next game to the highest ranked player
      5. Add Tournament Game to the Tournament Round
      6. Remove the Game Candidate Player and the Opponent Game Candidate Player from the Work Tournament Array
